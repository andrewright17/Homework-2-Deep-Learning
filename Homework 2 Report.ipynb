    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This seq2seq model was developed to generate captions for video input from the MSVD dataset. The model architecture is an encoder-decoder LSTM model with an attention mechanism that had a hidden_size of 512.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained for 100 epochs on 1450 videos with a learning rate of 0.0001. A build_dictionary function was used to construct mappings for words to indices (and vice versa) for words used more than 4 times among the training captions. The labels were also preprocessed using regex to clean up punctuation that may have complicated the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the model on 100 videos showed an average BLEU evaluation score of 0.684, which is above the baseline of 0.6. This shows that the model is accurately generating captions, but there is still room for improvement. Likely, I would make some changes to the architecture by adjusting the dimensions of the LSTM and attention layers as a first step. Below is an example of a generated caption from the model.\n",
